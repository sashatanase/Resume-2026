I’m Sasha Tanase Luca, a product leader who works at the intersection of discovery, research, and complex web3 systems (Ethereum and Bitcoin). I focus on finding and strengthening Product-Market Fit by digging deep into real user needs and translating those insights into clear product decisions. My work blends qualitative and quantitative research, customer value definition, and practical roadmap shaping. I’m at my best when I’m aligning teams around evidence and real data, clarifying what truly matters, and pushing for outcomes that serve both users and stakeholders. **To me, a successful product is one that balances customer needs with business goals, and proves its worth through real adoption.**

Alongside my product work, I’m an **active public speaker** at major web3 conferences such as Devcon and EthCC, where I share practical perspectives on product development, user research, UX, trust, and developer experience in decentralized systems.

### Experience
#### Mezo Network - Research Manager and Product Strategy
##### July 2024- July 2025
[Mezo Network ↗](https://mezonetwork.io)
- Led PMF-focused research for Mezo Network across discovery, segmentation, and value proposition validation. The research identified the exact user segment that consistently responded to Mezo Borrow, while invalidating several lower-fit segments. This sharpened product focus and helped concentrate efforts on the top 35–40% of users most likely to adopt and retain.

- Worked in close partnership with the Product Managers responsible for Mezo Borrow and Mezo Onboarding, translating research findings into concrete roadmap decisions. These insights directly influenced prioritization and helped elevate Mezo Borrow as the flagship product of the Mezo Network, driving the majority of early product engagement within two quarters.

- Coordinated cross-functional teams across Product, Design, Engineering, and Marketing, and built a centralized insight repository used across the company. The repository became the single source of truth for research, supporting 15+ stakeholders, reducing duplicate research efforts by approximately 30%, and accelerating decision-making across teams.

- Guided product teams with actionable insights that shaped roadmap sequencing and scope. Research inputs informed over 60% of roadmap decisions related to onboarding, borrowing flows, and user education, shortening validation cycles and reducing misaligned initiatives by roughly 25%.

- Ran Jobs-to-be-Done interviews, PMF surveys, and iterative discovery combining qualitative and quantitative signals. The outputs aligned Product and Marketing around a shared definition of the target user and enabled clearer messaging, contributing to a 20% uplift in qualified traffic and early-stage conversion for Mezo Borrow.

#### Threshold Network - Product Design and Research Lead
##### September 2021 - July 2024
[Threshold Network ↗](https://www.threshold.network/)
- Led post-merger discovery and stakeholder alignment following the Keep and NuCypher merge. Ran workshops and interviews to define shared product direction and brand identity, resulting in Brand Personality Guidelines, Target User Profiles, and validated product hypotheses. This work reduced roadmap rework and strategic misalignment by approximately 25%.

- Conducted deep research into Threshold’s core target audience: Bitcoin holders already exposed to DeFi. Validated assumptions around risk tolerance, yield expectations, and trust barriers, narrowing focus to higher-fit segments and contributing to a roughly 20% increase in early feature adoption across staking and bridging experiences.

- Owned the end-to-end strategy and delivery of the Threshold marketing website. Defined the information architecture and a segmented funnel tailored to different user profiles, led user flows, wireframes, and three rounds of usability testing, resulting in a 30% improvement in first-time task success and a 22% lift in product engagement from website entry points.

- Led end-to-end product discovery and delivery for the Threshold Network Dashboard, covering onboarding, legacy stake migration, new staker flows, and Node Operator experiences. Ran extensive research with stakers, node operators, service providers, and BTC-focused DeFi users. Research-driven iterations improved onboarding completion by approximately 25% and reduced time-to-first-stake by around 20%.

- Owned discovery, definition, and iteration of tBTC bridge v2. Ran exploratory research, validated product hypotheses, and collaborated closely with smart contract developers to align UX with protocol constraints. Delivered two validated iterations that improved successful bridge completion rates by approximately 18% and increased user confidence in the bridging process.

- Proposed and validated a third major iteration of the tBTC bridge based on user insights, introducing a dual-experience model with a fast consumer bridge and a slower, yield-bearing LP bridge. While not shipped, the proposal influenced internal strategy discussions around liquidity provisioning, scalability, and perceived PMF.

- Improved the tBTC Node Operator experience by redesigning client-code UX and documentation. Created a custom research methodology combining diary studies and interviews to evaluate real-world setup and maintenance workflows, reducing setup-related issues by approximately 30% and improving operator-reported clarity.

- Partnered with the CEO on a service blueprint initiative to optimize internal workflows across product, engineering, research, and operations. This work clarified ownership, reduced cross-team friction, and improved delivery speed by an estimated 15–20%.

#### Keep Network - Product Design and Research Lead 
##### April 2021 - September 2021
[Keep Network ↗](https://keep.network/)

- Ran deep discovery on Node Operator behavior and uncovered a new high-value segment: Staking Providers (B2B). This led to better documentation, clearer node-setup guides, and tighter communication on client-code updates reducing friction across the entire setup and node maintenance journey. These changes drove a 15% increase in active Node Operators and cut setup drop-offs by 30%. This was achieved through multiple validation cycles.

- Led discovery and validation for Coverage Pools, shaping the feature set and PMF strategy. User interviews revealed that many token holders wanted a lower-risk, passive-income option with less slashing. Acting on this insight, we designed a feature that tapped into idle tokens, ultimately locking 33% of the total supply and driving stronger engagement with network security.

- Led the end-to-end creation of Coverage Pools (before AAVE), the first feature of its kind in Ethereum DeFi at the time. Because the concept was completely new, I focused on transparency, clear guidance, and a simple 3-step mental model to help users understand how it worked. I ran deep discovery interviews and usability tests centered on learnability and recall. By the end of testing, 87% of participants accurately remembered the full 3-step flow, confirming strong comprehension of a complex new feature.

- Partnered with Product Marketing to shape GTM strategy and update the website and in-app messaging for new feature launches. These changes improved clarity, strengthened trust signals, and drove a 22% lift in early-stage adoption within the first quarter from the Coverage Pool feature launch.
